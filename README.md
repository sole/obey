This is the source code for this fantastic silly idea I had once. Enjoy!

## Hacking

If you want to play with the code, just clone this repository and edit the sources in the `src` folder.

You can use the `gulpfile.js` to generate a distributable compressed version. Just run `npm install` first and then once everything has been installed just do `npm run build`. The output will be placed in a `dist` folder.

You probably don't need to do that unless you're me, but you might find interesting to see how I've done all the compressing, concatenating, etc.
